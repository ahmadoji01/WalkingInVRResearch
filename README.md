# WalkingInVRResearch
This repository contains a VR Project I have done on late 2017 at Kanagawa Institute of Technology (KAIT), Japan

Basically the main function of the program is to help the research I performed back at that university. The research actually conveys a conclusion of which is the best Virtual Reality device out on the market. It compares Google Cardboard, Oculus Rift, and Cave Automated Virtual Environment owned by KAIT. Here the walking case is chosen to evaluate the best out of 3 mentioned devices. Details of the research background, implementation, and result can be seen on the Documentation folder

This program basically provides 3 scenes (Google StreetView, 3D Objects, and 360-Camera pictures). A gyroscope sensor owned by the smartphone is used as a way to detect how fast user moves. The data obtained from the sensor is thus sent to the processing unit. The processing unit for Google Cardboard is smartphone, PC for Oculus Rift, and High-Performance PC for CAVE. Data is sent through LAN and then processed on the respective processing unit to compute and in turn to sense how fast user moves. The details of how the program works can be found on the Documentation folder as well
